# Tableau project

**Background**

Since 2013, the Citi Bike Program has implemented a robust infrastructure for collecting data on the program's utilization. Through the team's efforts, each month bike data is collected, organized, and made public on the Citi Bike Data webpage.

**Goal**

Use Tableau to rapidly manipulate tables of data and create visualizations using a drag-and-drop style interface.
Connect various data formats such as CSV and Excel Workbooks to Tableau.
Perform exploratory data analysis using Tableau.

**Instructions**

- Aggregate the data found in the Citi Bike Trip History Logs and find two unexpected phenomena.
- Design 2-5 visualizations for each discovered phenomena (4-10 total). You may work with a timespan of your choosing.
- Create some questions you may wish to tackle.
- Use your visualizations (does not have to be all of them) to design a dashboard for each phenomena.
- The dashboards should be accompanied with an analysis explaining why the phenomena may be occuring.
- Create a Tableau story that brings together the visualizations, requested maps, and dashboards.

**Submission** 
Your final submission should include:

A link to your Tableau Public workbook that includes:

- 4-10 Total "Phenomenon" Visualizations
- 2 Dashboards
- 1 City Official Map
- 1 Story
- A text or markdown file with your analysis on the phenomenons you uncovered from the data.
